# Interval Timer

A beginner learning project: a personal interval timer web app, developed on Windows with Codex and used mainly on an iPhone 12.

## First version

- Adjustable exercise time, rest time, and number of rounds.
- A three-second countdown before the workout starts.
- Large remaining-time, current-phase, and current-round displays.
- Audible cues during the final five seconds of exercise and rest, with a distinct cue at phase changes.
- Start, Pause/Resume, and Reset controls.
- Skip rest after the final exercise and play a distinct completion sound.
- Test audio early on the actual iPhone alongside music from the YouTube app, with the timer visible and the screen unlocked.
- No accounts or backend.

## Later

- Offline use.
- Adding the app to the iPhone Home Screen.

## Working approach

Keep the implementation simple, explain new technical terms and any proposed dependencies, work in small steps, and verify each result. Save working checkpoints with Git and GitHub.

## Current status

Lesson 1: a single sound button. The timer has not been implemented yet.

## Run the sound lesson

From the project folder in PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0 --directory public
```

This starts a local development server: a temporary program on your PC that sends the page to your browser. It serves only the `public` folder. No extra packages are needed. Stop it with Ctrl+C.

On the PC, open <http://localhost:8000>. For iPhone testing, keep the PC running, connect both devices to the same home Wi-Fi network, and use `http://YOUR-PC-IP:8000` in Safari. The PC's IPv4 address is listed by `ipconfig`. Windows Firewall or Wi-Fi isolation may prevent the phone from connecting; diagnose that if needed rather than disabling protections.

## Files in this lesson

- `public/index.html`: HTML describes the page's content and button.
- `public/styles.css`: CSS controls the layout, colors, and button size.
- `public/app.js`: JavaScript responds to a tap and generates one short beep.

The Web Audio API is the browser's built-in sound interface. The script creates an `AudioContext` (the browser's sound workspace) in response to a tap. Where supported, it requests `ambient` audio so the beep can mix with other audio. This is a browser request, not a guarantee of iPhone behavior.

## Verify this milestone

1. Without music, tap **Play test sound**. Expect a short beep and the message **Test finished. Did you hear the beep?** The message confirms that playback finished in the browser, not that the device speaker was audible.
2. Tap again to check that the button works repeatedly.
3. On the iPhone, turn Silent Mode off and choose a comfortable media volume.
4. Start music in the YouTube app, then return to Safari. Note if the music stops before tapping.
5. With Safari visible and the screen unlocked, tap the button. Report whether the beep is audible and whether music continues.

The YouTube app must already support playback while another app is visible for this setup to work. If music stops as soon as you leave YouTube, that is a separate issue from this sound button.

iPhone audio alongside YouTube is awaiting a real-device test. Delayed workout cues will need another test when the timer is added.
